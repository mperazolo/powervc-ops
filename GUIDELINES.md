# Developing

As of now there are no special guidelines on how to develop, format or organize code contributed to this repository. As long as it is valid code (Ansible, Scripts, Python, etc.) and contributes new function or fixes our community is open to submissions. If there are any specific comments they will be addressed in the pull request.

&nbsp;

# Verifying

We ask that prior to submitting a pull request potential contributors verify their code works and that it is generally supports this repository's target environments: OpenPOWER Systems hosting operating systems for both the "Debian" (which includes Debian, Ubuntu) and the "RedHat" (which includes CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux) families. In the future we also intend to support "AIX" endpoints, so please consider developing and testing in these same environments.

# Future Changes

This community reserves the right to update and modify these guidelines at any time.
